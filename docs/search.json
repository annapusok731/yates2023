    "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social communication, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. A fundamental aspect of social communication is face perception, which has been extensively studied in ASD research. The composite face effect (CFE; Young et al., 1987) is a measure of holistic face processing, and typically developing children show evidence of the CFE as early as four years of age. In contrast, individuals with ASD often exhibit atypical face processing, thought to stem from reduced holistic perception and employing more feature-based strategies. However, holistic face processing is cruical for social communication processes, such as emotion recognition. Although several studies have examined the CFE in adolescents and adults with ASD, findings have been inconsistent. To date, however, no research has investigated the CFE in young children with ASD. My first year project aims to fill this gap by testing holistic face processing in young children with ASD. As a first step, for my statistics project, I want to pilot the task with neurotypical adults to validate the paradigm and ensure the procedure is feasible before extending it to child populations. Yates & Lewkowicz tested the CFE paradigm in children ages 4-6, with findings that kids as young as 4 exhibit holistic face processing, so I am planning to replicate their study.\nFor the stimuli, I plan to use a Caucasian hairless faces (male and female) with neutral expressions, from the Chicago Face Database. The face images will be grayscale displayed on a white screen, and the top parts of the faces will be highlighted, consistent with prior (Yates & Lewkowicz, 2023). Yates & Lewkowicz presented 36 trials, for the adult sample, I plan to do more based on power analysis. //I will meet with Jane to discuss what is the best number of trials for the experiment based on power analysis. I do plan to use different analysis methods once I collect both neurotypical and ASD data given that Yates & Lewkowicz only had neurotypical kid data only and for the class, I’m only collecting neurotypical adult data.\nThe procedure will include two practice trials, the first one being spatially aligned composite faces where the top halves are of different faces, the other being spatially misaligned with same top halves. Participants will receive feedback during the practice trials, and the experiment only advances forward when participants select the correct choice. The test phase will consist of 2 blocks of 36 test trials with a short break between the blocks.\nAbout 24 neurotypical adult participants will be recruited for the final project. This sample size was according to Hsiung & Chien (2024.) They conducted a power analysis and determined that 24 neurotypical and ASD adults are a good number. I uploaded that paper to my original_paper folder.\nThe main challenge will be ensuring that participants remain attentive through the trials. For that, I’ll be including an exclusion criteria that if participants said all “same” or all “different” responses, which would be an indicator of not paying attention. Participants who also fail to finish the experiment will also be excluded.\nLink to paper: https://github.com/annapusok731/yates2023/tree/2885fd3f36660e431e4876c7b2f4dec89f9b7a79/original_paper\nRepository: https://github.com/annapusok731/yates2023.git"

    "text": "Methods\n\nPower Analysis\nOriginal effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size. Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.\n\n\nPlanned Sample\nFor the adult sample, we aimed for 15 adults.\n\n\nMaterials\nAll materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.\n\n\nProcedure\nCan quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\nCan also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section. The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.\nClarify key analysis of interest here You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.\n\n\nDifferences from Original Study\nExplicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study. The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.\n\n\nMethods Addendum (Post Data Collection)\nYou can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.\n\nActual Sample\nSample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan\n\n\nDifferences from pre-data collection methods plan\nAny differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nSummary of Replication Attempt\nOpen the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.\n\n\nCommentary\nAdd open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long."
